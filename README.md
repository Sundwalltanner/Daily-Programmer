# Daily Programmer
This repository contains a collection of programs I've coded for [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/), a subreddit dedicated to providing programmers with 3 different challenges every week with increasing difficulty in order to help programmers practice and hone their programming skills.

## cpp
I've used C++ the most frequently, so I'll likely have more challenges completed in this folder than any other folder. I am starting to like Rust a bit though.

## Rust
As mentioned, I've been using Rust a lot more recently, and I've been really enjoying it. I made [a Nonogram game](https://github.com/Sundwalltanner/Rust-Nonogram) in Rust that I'm quite proud of.
