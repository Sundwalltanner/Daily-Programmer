# Daily Programmer
This repository contains a collection of programs I've coded for [/r/dailyprogrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/), a subreddit dedicated to providing programmers with 3 different challenges every week with increasing difficulty in order to help programmers practice and hone their programming skills.

## cpp
I've used C++ the most frequently, so I'll likely have more challenges completed in this folder than any other folder. I am starting to like Rust a bit though.

* [[2020-03-09] Challenge #383 [Easy] Necklace matching](https://github.com/Sundwalltanner/Daily-Programmer/blob/master/cpp/necklace_matching/main.cpp)

## Rust
I started off by attempting to convert my necklace matching challenge in C++, but it's not going all that well due to how strings work in Rust.
